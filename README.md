# Shooting_Crime_Analysis

### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insight into shooting crimes in the city of Ney York between the periods of 2006 and 2023. By analyzing this crime data, we seek to uncover trends and patterns based on factors such as borough, victim demography and incident frequency.

### Data Sources

Crime Data: The primary dataset used for the analysis is the "NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Historic__20241123" file, containing detailed information about shooting crimes.

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning/ Data Analysis/ Dashboard

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1.  Handled missing values
2.  Standardized categorical fields
3.  Filtered unnecessary or irrelevant records

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the data to answer key questions such as:

- Which Borough has the highest shooting incident?
- Which race and gender are more likley to be shooting victims?
- What time of the day are shooting incidents highest?

### Data Analysis

Used Pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data. The key features employed were Grouping, Calculated Fields and Slicers.

### Results/ Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.  Brooklyn had the most shooting incident followed by Bronx
2.  Black and Male victims significantly outnumbers all other victims
3.  Highest number of incidents involved victims aged 25-44, followed by 18-24
4.  Shooting incidents are highest at night, between 9pm and 1am

### Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
1. Focus city resources in Brooklyn and Bronx by increasing police visibility and patrols in high-incident boroughs.
2. Invest in community based outreach programs targeted at the youth as most victims fall withing 18-44 to reduce the risk of violence
3. Enhance awareness by educating the public and stakeholders on incident trends

### Limitations

- Inaccuracies in location coordinates
- Some years are underrepresented in the dataset

### Conclusion

This project vizualizes shooting incidents in NYC, highlighting demographic and geographical disparities. The dashboard is a useful tool for stakeholders like city officials, public safety advocates and policymakers to:
-  Allocate resoucrces more efectively
-  Identify at risk groups
-  Track progress of safety interventions
